# What is the best playing order for the Pokémon games?

There is no right or wrong answer. But if you intend to play most of them, you could go in release order as the newer games often have QOL improvements so jumping from new to old games might not give you a good impression of them.

However, **if you want to have a fast catch up**, you can just play the newer games (such as only the nintendo switch games).

Also to note that there is a difference between generation and region so if you are playing by generation you would most likely play both the original and remakes. **If you are going by region, you could just play the remakes in most cases.**

Remakes more or less follow the same story but with qol improvements from the new generation they are released in. Though some do make changes to the story but still follow the same general plot. And then you also have enhanced version released after the original pair. Enhanced version is an upgrade and also change the story to focus on the third legendary instead of just one.

### Game list in generation order:

- Gen 1: *(Red / Blue / Yellow (Kanto) optional)*

- Gen 2: *(Gold / Silver / Crystal (Johto) optional)*

- Gen 3: *(Ruby / Sapphire (Hoenn) optional / skip)* > **Firered / Leafgreen (Kanto) > Emerald (Hoenn)**

- Gen 4: *(Diamond / Pearl (Sinnoh) optional/skip)* > **Heartgold / Soulsilver (Johto) > Platinum (Sinnoh)** 

- Gen 5: **Black / White (Unova) > Black 2 / White 2 (Unova)**

- Gen 6: **X / Y (Kalos) > Omega Ruby / Alpha Sapphire (Hoenn)**

- Gen 7: *(Sun / Moon optional)* > **Ultra Sun / Ultra Moon (Alola)** > *(Lets Go Pikachu / Eevee (Kanto) optional)*

- Gen 8: **Sword / Shield + DLC (Galar)** > *(Brilliant Diamond / Shining Pearl (Sinnoh) optional)* > **Legends Arceus (Hisui)** ->

- Gen 9: **Scarlet / Violet + DLC (Paldea) > Legends Z-A (Lumiose)**

### Game list in region order:

- **Kanto:** Firered / Leafgreen *(Gen 3)*
- **Hoenn:** Emerald *(Gen 3)* > Omega Ruby / Alpha Sapphire* *(Gen 6)*
- **Johto:** Heartgold / Soulsilver *(Gen 4)*
- **Sinnoh:** Platinum *(Gen 4)*
- **Unova:** Black / White *(Gen 5)* > Black 2 / White 2 *(Gen 5)*
- **Kalos:** X / Y *(Gen 6)*
- **Alola:** Ultra Sun / Ultra Moon *(Gen 7)*
- **Galar:** Sword / Shield + DLC *(Gen 8)*
- **Hisui:** Legends Arceus *(Gen 8)*
- **Paldea:** Scarlet / Violet + DLC *(Gen 9)*
- **Lumiose:** Legends Z-A *(Gen 9)*

**: Play OR/AS just when playing Gen 6 (X/Y).*

### Final notes

Gen 1 and gen 2 are optional because they are remade in gen 3 and 4, and the story is mostly similar so not required to play through them again. But if you are going by generation, you should give it a try to see how the games evolved.

Ruby sapphire can be skipped since it has an enhanced version (emerald) which combine the two story. There is also a remake in gen 6 so you can play that instead if you want to see the original story involving only 1 legendary, but it does includes elements from x/y's story too.

Same for diamond pearl. Platinum is the enhanced version. And there is a remake in gen 8 so not really needed to play diamond pearl.

Ultra Sun / Ultra Moon are enhanced version of Sun / Moon, so Sun / Moon are optional. However unlike the previous enhanced version, there are more changes to the story (but they are still 75% similar). General consensus is Sun / Moon has the better story but the Ultra games being enhanced version is still better. If you do decide to play Sun Moon, at least switch the version when you play the Ultra version (so Sun then Ultra Moon for example)

Lets Go Pikachu / Eevee is another remake of gen 1, but it uses far more simplified mechanics as it is aimed at the pokemon go players to transition them into the main series proper. So not really needed since you would have prior knowledge of pokemon by playing through the older games already, but it is a Kanto game in a new engine so if you are playing by generation instead of region, you can consider adding it.
